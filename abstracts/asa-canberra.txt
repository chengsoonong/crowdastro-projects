Machine learning radio host cross-identification with crowdsourced labels

We propose a machine learning approach for radio host cross-identifications,
the task of finding the host galaxy in infrared corresponding to the radio emissions.
Traditional machine learning requires a large amount of labelled
training data, which can be difficult or expensive to acquire. Radio Galaxy Zoo
is a citizen science project which provides a large number of radio host
cross-identifications, which may be used as training labels for machine learning
algorithms. However, these cross-identifications may be incorrect,
as they are assigned by non-experts. We investigate the use of
crowdsourced training data from the Radio Galaxy Zoo to train machine learning
methods for radio host cross-identification in the CDFS field. We find that
despite the inaccuracies in the cross-identifications provided by the crowd,
Radio Galaxy Zoo labels are still useful for training.
We compare several different approaches, including random forests, logistic regression,
and neural networks.
We show that methods trained on Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications achieve
accuracies comparable to those trained with expert cross-identifications.
