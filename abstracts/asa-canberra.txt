Next generation radio telescopes will produce a large amount of data, which are
expected to require new methods to process. These methods may be
machine-learned, but machine learning requires a large amount of labelled
training data, which can be difficult or expensive to acquire. Radio Galaxy Zoo
is a citizen science project which provides a large number of radio host
cross-identifications, which may be used as training labels for machine-learned
cross-identification algorithms. However, these cross-identifications may be
incorrect, as they are assigned by non-experts. We investigate the use of
crowdsourced training data from the Radio Galaxy Zoo to train machine-learned
methods for radio host cross-identification in the CDFS field. We find that
despite the inaccuracies in the training cross-identifications, Radio Galaxy Zoo
labels are still useful for training, and that methods trained on Radio Galaxy
Zoo cross-identifications achieve accuracies comparable to those trained with
expert cross-identifications.
