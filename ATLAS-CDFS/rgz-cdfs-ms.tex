\begin{abstract}
  We present a machine learning approach for radio host cross-identification,
  the task of determining the host galaxies of radio emissions detected in
  wide-area radio surveys. Training a machine learning algorithm requires a
  large amount [TODO: how large?] of labelled training data, which can be
  difficult or expensive to acquire. Radio Galaxy Zoo, a citizen science
  project on the Zooniverse platform, provides a large number of radio host
  cross-identifications which may be used as labels for training. However,
  these cross-identifications are assigned by non-experts, and may be
  incorrect. We find that while machine learning algorithms trained on expert
  labels outperform those trained on the crowdsourced Radio Galaxy Zoo labels,
  the accuracies are comparable and the crowdsourced labels are still useful
  for training. [TODO: add balanced accuracies]

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

  Next generation radio telescopes such as the Australian SKA Pathfinder
  (ASKAP; Johnston et al. 2007) and Apertif (Verheijen et al. 2008) will
  conduct increasingly wide, deep, and high-resolution surveys. These
  surveys will produce very large amounts of data. The Evolutionary Map of
  the Universe survey (EMU; Norris et al. 2011) using ASKAP and the WODAN
  survey (RÃ¶ttgering et al. 2011) using Apertif are expected to detect
  over 100 million radio sources between them, compared to the 2.5 million
  radio sources already known (Banfield et al. 2015).

  An important part of processing this data is cross-identifying observed
  radio emission regions with observations of their host galaxy in surveys
  at other wavelengths. Radio host cross-identification is a difficult
  task. While pointlike sources of radio emission are easy to
  cross-identify as they directly overlap the host galaxy, a large
  proportion of radio sources are considerably more complex. Radio
  emissions from radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be
  complicated structures not clearly related to the host galaxy, and are
  often composed of multiple, separate components. These AGN are expected
  to dominate approximately 30\% of sources detected by EMU (Norris et al.
  2011). Small surveys of a few thousand sources such as the Australia
  Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS; Norris et al. 2006, Middelberg et
  al. 2008) can be cross-identified manually, but this is impractical for
  larger surveys.

  One approach to cross-identification is crowdsourcing, where members of
  the public volunteer to cross-identify radio emissions with their host
  galaxies. This is the premise of Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ; Banfield et al.
  2015, Wong et al. 2017), a citizen science project hosted on the highly
  successful Zooniverse platform (Lintott et al. ?). Volunteers are shown
  images of the radio sky, and are asked to identify the morphology of
  radio sources in each image. They are then asked to cross-identify each
  radio source with its host galaxy in a corresponding infrared image.
  Radio Galaxy Zoo provides a large dataset of 100~267 radio host
  cross-identifications and radio source morphologies (Wong et al., 2017).
  {[}TODO(Julie): Provide numbers and explain why this is not
  efficient.{]}

  Automated algorithms have been developed for this cross-identification
  problem. Fan et al. (2015) developed a method of cross-identification
  using Bayesian hypothesis testing, fitting a three-component model to
  extended radio sources under the assumption that radio sources are
  composed of a core radio component and two lobe components. The core
  radio component is coincident with the host galaxy, so
  cross-identification amounts to finding the galaxy coincident with the
  core in the most likely model fit. This method is easily extended to use
  other, more complex models, but it is purely geometric and does not
  incorporate other information such as the colours of the potential host
  galaxy. Additionally, there may be new classes of radio source detected
  in future surveys like EMU which do not fit the model, and it is these
  radio sources that are of most interest. Weston et al. (2017, in
  preparation) developed a modification of the likelihood ratio method of
  cross-identification (Richter, 1975) for application to EMU. However,
  this method is only intended to cross-identify ``simple'' sources
  consisting of a single, isolated radio component (Norris 2016).
  {[}TODO(Julie): Can you elaborate on this?{]}

  ASKAP is expected to generate approximately 70 PB yearly (Norris 2016).
  Automated methods will be needed to choose what data to keep and what to
  discard {[}TODO: Cite this? It's in EMU 2011 I think{]}. While data can
  be selected for preservation by model-based methods, it is clear that
  these methods would miss the unexpected objects we expect to find in
  EMU. EMU will therefore employ some kind of algorithm for looking for
  these unexpected objects (Norris 2016), which may be of the form of an
  outlier detector. Outliers can be detected in a variety of ways,
  including imposing a similarity metric on radio components and looking
  for objects very distant from other objects (Polsterer et al. 2015),
  looking for objects that do not reliably fit existing models (a simple
  extension of Fan et al. 2015), or generating a model of radio galaxies
  from existing data and looking for objects that do not fit this model.
  These methods all require a way of encoding the {[}SOMETHING SOMETHING
  FEATURE SELECTION{]} For these algorithms, robust feature selection is
  important and model-based approaches (e.g.~Proctor 2006) will likely
  fail.

  {[}TODO: Examples of some complex radio emissions{]}

  {[}TODO: literature review: paper Ivy sent, PINK, WTF, Fan (done),
  Proctor, Park et al. 2017{]}

  {[}TODO: Note that outlier detection can be done in lots of different
  ways including with this work and there are benefits in both. Also an
  example of where model-based approaches fall down. Elaborate on this?{]}

  In order to investigate methods for efficiently and effectively
  classifying radio galaxy hosts for upcoming large radio surveys, we have
  developed a machine learning approach for radio host
  cross-identification using standard machine learning techniques.

  {[}TODO: Define ``component'' and ``source'' and ``primary component'',
  ``host'', etc, using a figure.{]}

\section{Data}\label{data}

  \subsection{Radio Galaxy Zoo}\label{radio-galaxy-zoo}

    Radio Galaxy Zoo asks volunteers to cross-identify radio components with
    their infrared host galaxies. A total of 177~461 radio components are
    sourced from ATLAS (Franzen et al. 2015.) and Faint Images of the Radio
    Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST; White et al. 1997). These components
    are cross-identified to host galaxies detected in the \emph{Spitzer}
    Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey (SWIRE; Lonsdale et al. 2003)
    and by the \emph{Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer} (WISE; Wright et
    al. 2010), respectively.

    Volunteers are presented with a random radio image centred on a radio
    component, and a corresponding infrared image centred on the same
    location. The radio image may contain multiple radio components.
    Classification of these images is a two-step process. First, volunteers
    select which radio components are part of the same radio source. Second,
    volunteers associate each radio source with a host galaxy visible in the
    infrared image. A more detailed description can be found in Banfield et
    al. (2015).

    To reduce noise, each radio component is shown to multiple volunteers.
    Compact radio components are shown to 5 volunteers, while extended radio
    components are shown to 20 volunteers. Once a radio object has been
    classified by the required number of volunteers, it is considered
    ``complete''. Complete classifications are combined to produce the final
    catalogue of Radio Galaxy Zoo morphologies and cross-identifications.
    The most commonly chosen associations of radio components to radio
    sources are chosen as the radio morphology classification for the image.
    The host galaxy locations selected by volunteers who agreed with the
    most common radio morphology classification are combined by maximising
    over a kernel density estimate of the locations. These locations are
    then matched to the nearest SWIRE object within 5 arcseconds {[}TODO:
    check this{]}. A full description of the catalogue generation can be
    found in Wong et al. (2017). There are currently 97~807 complete
    classifications of FIRST components, and 2460 complete classifications
    of ATLAS components (the latter comprising the entire \emph{Chandra}
    Deep Field - South).

    In this paper we focus on the Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications of
    the ATLAS and SWIRE surveys. There are two main reasons for this. The
    first is that ATLAS is the pilot study for EMU where automated methods
    like ours will be used. The second is that ATLAS is composed of two
    fields, so we can train methods on one field and test these methods on
    the other field to ensure that our methods apply in different areas of
    the sky. {[}TODO(Julie): Am I interpreting your comments on this
    correctly?{]}

    Each primary component found in the ATLAS DR3 component catalogue
    appears in Radio Galaxy Zoo. Non-primary components may appear within
    the image of a primary component, but do not have their own entry in
    Radio Galaxy Zoo. We will henceforth only discuss the primary
    components. For ATLAS components, the radio and infrared images shown to
    volunteers are \(2' \times 2'\).

  \subsection{ATLAS}\label{atlas}

    ATLAS (Franzen et al. 2013) is a wide-area radio survey of the
    \emph{Chandra} Deep Field - South (CDFS) and the ESO Large Area ISO
    Survey - South 1 (ELAIS-S1) fields at 1.4 GHz. It is a pilot survey for
    the EMU (Norris et al. 2011) survey that will be conducted with ASKAP.
    EMU will cover the entire southern sky and is expected to detect
    approximately 70 million new radio sources. EMU will be conducted at the
    same depth and resolution as ATLAS, so methods developed for processing
    ATLAS data are expected to work for EMU. {[}TODO: How large are CDFS and
    ELAIS-S1? How many radio objects do they contain?{]} ATLAS has a
    sensitivity of 14 ÂµJy on CDFS and 17 ÂµJy on ELAIS-S1 (Franzen et al.
    2013).

    Norris et al. (2006) produced a catalogue of cross-identifications of
    784 radio sources with their infrared counterparts in SWIRE {[}Section
    ????{]}. Middelberg et al. (2007) produced a catalogue of
    cross-identifications of {[}NNNN{]} radio sources with their infrared
    counterparts in SWIRE. {[}TODO: Make this less clunky and talk about Fan
    et al.{]}

    Radio Galaxy Zoo {[}Section ???{]} produced a catalogue of crowdsourced
    cross-identifications of 2460 ATLAS radio objects in CDFS (Wong et al.
    2017). As these cross-identifications have been based on volunteer
    classifications, this catalogue is expected to be less accurate than an
    expert catalogue like that produced by Norris et al. (2006). {[}TODO:
    Discuss this paragraph with Julie{]}

  \subsection{SWIRE}\label{swire}

    The Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic survey (Lonsdale et al.,
    ????) is a wide-area infrared survey at the four IRAC wavelengths 3.6
    Âµm, 4.5 Âµm, 5.8 Âµm, and 8.0 Âµm. It covers the eight SWIRE fields,
    particularly CDFS and ELAIS-S1, both of which were also covered by
    ATLAS. SWIRE is thus the source of infrared observations for
    cross-identification with ATLAS.

  \section{Method}\label{method}

  \subsection{Cross-identification as binary
  classification}\label{cross-identification-as-binary-classification}

    We focus on the problem of cross-identification without reference to radio
    morphology. Given a radio component, we want to find its host galaxy as a
    citizen scientist would using Radio Galaxy Zoo. The input is thus a radio
    image and an infrared image, with radius \(R\). We make the assumption
    that each radio image represents a single, complex extended source. This
    is not the case in general and a radio image may contain many different
    sources (e.g. Radio Galaxy Zoo uses cutouts where \(R = 1'\), and these
    often contain multiple sources). We also note that this will bias our
    results against radio emission that extends beyond the \(R\) cutout size.
    The radio cross-identification task then amounts to locating the host
    galaxy within the associated radio and infrared images. This is formalised
    as an object localisation problem: Given a radio image and an infrared
    image, locate the host galaxy.

    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[trim={5cm 0cm 4cm 5cm}, width=0.5\linewidth]{images/windows.eps}
      \caption{Localising the host galaxy in a radio image. Red boxes
        represent windows centred on various locations in the image. The image
        patches from each window are shown beneath. The image patch of each
        window represents the location the window is centred on. The
        probabilities of each patch coinciding with the host galaxy would then
        be estimated. The probabilities shown are for illustration only. In
        this example, the centre window of the image would be chosen as the
        location of the host galaxy, as the window centred on it has the
        highest probability.}
      \label{fig:windows}
    \end{figure}

    A common approach to object localisation is to estimate the probability
    that each location in the image is coincident with the desired object. In
    practice this amounts to taking fixed-size windows of the image centred on
    each pixel and estimating the probability that each window is centred on
    the object. The location associated with the highest probability window is
    then assumed to be the location of the object. Applying this to radio host
    cross-identification, we consider $32 \times 32$ pixel windows of a
    radio/infrared image and estimate the probability that each window is
    centred on the host galaxy. This approach is illustrated in Figure
    \ref{fig:windows}.

    This task can be made greatly more efficient if we have a prior on the
    location of the object we are localising. For our prior, we assume that
    the host galaxy is always visible in the infrared and thus we only need
    consider windows centred on infrared sources. This assumption usually
    holds, except for a rare class of infrared-faint radio sources (Norris
    et al. 2006) {[}TODO: How many? I think it was 10{]}. This leads us to a
    binary classification task: Given an infrared source, compute the
    probability that it is a host galaxy. To find the host galaxy given a
    radio source, classify each galaxy within \(R\) of the source and select
    the galaxy with the highest probability of being a host galaxy. This is
    a good formulation as binary classification is a very common problem in
    machine learning and there are many different methods readily available
    to solve it.

    Solving the radio cross-identification task amounts to modelling a
    function \(f\) from infrared sources \(\mathcal{X}\) to binary
    \(\mathcal{Y} = \{0, 1\}\): \[
        f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}
    \] There are many options for modelling \(f\). In this paper we apply
    three different models: logistic regression, random forests, and
    convolutional neural networks. As a linear method, logistic regression
    is the simplest classification approach we can take. Convolutional
    neural networks have recently shown strong results on image-based
    classification tasks. Random forests {[}something something{]}.

    The space of infrared sources \(\mathcal{X}\) needs to be encoded as a
    vector for the models we will use. We describe this in {[}Section
    Representation{]}.

    The key problem with this approach is our assumption that the radio sky
    within radius \(R\) contains only one, complete radio source. The
    problem is two-fold: This radius may contain multiple sources, or it may
    not contain the entirety of the source. If the radius contains multiple
    sources then there will also be multiple hosts in our input images
    (which breaks our assumption that there is only one); even a perfect
    classifier can only accurately cross-identify \emph{one} host in an
    image with multiple. If the radius does not contain the whole source,
    then we are missing radio information useful for finding the host
    galaxy. This is a difficult problem in general (even for RGZ) as radio
    sources can be extremely wide. RGZ found a wide-angled tail radio source
    that spanned over three different images presented to volunteers and the
    full source was only cross-identified by the efforts of citizen
    scientists (Banfield et al. 2016). The problems are in opposition to
    each other: To reduce the number of sources in an input image, we can
    reduce \(R\), but this increases the chance that we will miss relevant
    radio source information, and vice versa.

    For our experiments, we take \(R = 1'\), as in the images presented to
    RGZ volunteers. Our assumptions impose an upper bound on how well we can
    cross-identify radio sources, which can be estimated by considering how
    accurately a \emph{perfect} binary classifier cross-identifies radio
    sources under our method. Using the Norris et al. (2006) labels
    (Section: Labels) to classify SWIRE objects to 100\% accuracy on the
    binary classification task results in a cross-identification accuracy of
    89\% {[}method? where do I put this{]}, which we take as an upper bound
    on our cross-identification accuracy.

    It is unclear what size window to choose. If we choose a very large
    window, then we may get windows that contain multiple radio objects, or
    classifying may be computationally difficult. If we choose a very small
    window, then the window may not capture the whole radio source and we
    may not be able to accurately classify {[}TODO: see also ARG0003sky, the
    RGZ wide radio galaxy{]}

    {[}TODO: Explicitly list assumptions and show examples of where they
    break. Will likely need to combine this with the above three
    paragraphs.{]}

    {[}TODO: add a diagram of this pipeline since while it's a very common
    approach to object localisation it's not all that common in
    astrophysics{]}

  \subsection{Vector representation of infrared
  sources}\label{vector-representation-of-infrared-sources}

    {[}TODO: Discuss comments on ``vector'' with Julie{]}

    Most binary classification methods require that the inputs to be
    classified are real-valued vectors. We thus need to choose a vector
    representation of our candidate host galaxies, also known as the
    ``features'' of the galaxies.

    {[}TODO: Add a plot of the SWIRE flux distributions along with the
    wedges{]}

    Infrared observations of the CDFS field are taken from SWIRE. We use the
    CDFS Fall '05 SWIRE catalogue {[}cite{]} to generate candidate hosts to
    classify. Radio observations of the CDFS field are taken from ATLAS. As
    almost all infrared sources in SWIRE look essentially the same (and
    differences in structure are likely irrelevant to whether the galaxy is
    a host galaxy), the candidate host location encodes almost all
    information we could gain from the infrared image. We therefore only use
    the radio image for object localisation.

    We represent each candidate host as 1034 real-valued features. For a given
    candidate host, these features are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The logarithm of the ratio of fluxes of the candidate host in the
        four IRAC wavelengths,
      \item The stellarity index of the host in both 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5
        $\mu$m,
      \item The flux of the host in 3.6 $\mu$m,
      \item The radial distance between the candidate host and the nearest
        radio component in the ATLAS catalogue, and
      \item A 32 $\times$ 32 pixel image from ATLAS, centred on the candidate
        host.
    \end{itemize}

    The flux ratios are indicators of the star formation rate and amount of
    dust in the galaxy and might thus be predictors of whether the galaxy
    contains an AGN {[}Julie?{]} \ref{fig:magdiff}. The stellarity index
    represents how likely the object is to be a star rather than a galaxy.
    The flux {[}why? Julie?{]}.

    We chose to use a 32 $\times$ 32 pixel image as it seemed to give a
    good balance between performance and computational efficiency.

  \subsection{Logistic regression}\label{logistic-regression}

    Logistic regression is the simplest classification model we can apply.
    It is linear in the feature space and outputs the probability that the
    input has a positive label. The model is

    \[
        f(\vec x) = \sigma(\vec w \cdot \vec x + b)
    \] where \(\vec w \in \mathbb{R}^D\) is a weights vector,
    \(b \in \mathbb{R}\) is a bias term, \(\vec x \in \mathbb{R}^D\) is the
    feature representation of a candidate host, and \(\sigma\) is the
    logistic sigmoid function \[
        \sigma(a) = (1 + \mathrm{exp}(-a))^{-1}.
    \]

  \subsection{Convolutional neural
  networks}\label{convolutional-neural-networks}

    Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a biologically-inspired
    prediction model for prediction with image inputs. A number of filters
    are convolved with the image to produce output images, and these outputs
    can then be convolved again with other filters on subsequent layers,
    producing a network of convolutions. This whole network is
    differentiable with respect to the values of the filters, and so the
    filters can be learned by gradient methods. The final layer of the
    network is logistic regression, with the convolved outputs as input
    features.

    CNNs have recently produced good results on large image-based datasets,
    which is why we employ them in this paper. We employ only a simple model
    --- CNNs can be arbitrarily complex --- as this is a proof of concept.

    {[}TODO: Add CNN diagram and example of a CNN reducing a radio image.{]}

  \subsection{Random Forests}\label{random-forests}

    Random forests are an ensemble of decision trees. {[}todo{]}

  \subsection{Labels}\label{labels}

    Converting the RGZ and Norris et al. (2006) cross-identification
    catalogues to binary labels for infrared objects is a non-trivial task.
    The most obvious problem is that there is no way to capture radio
    morphology information in binary classification. As a result, we ignore
    this problem for this paper. Another problem is that there is no way to
    indicate \emph{which} radio object an infrared object is associated
    with, only that it is associated with \emph{some} radio object. We make
    the naÃ¯ve assumption that any given radio image contains only one host
    galaxy as the first method in solving this problem.

    We then generate positive labels from a cross-identification catalogue.
    We decide that if an infrared object is listed in the catalogue, then it
    is assigned a positive label as a host galaxy. In principle we would
    then assign every other galaxy a negative label. This has some problems
    --- an example is that if the cross-identifier did not observe a radio
    object (e.g.~it was below the signal-to-noise ratio) then the host
    galaxy of that radio object would receive a negative label. {[}TODO:
    Count how many times this happens in Norris/RGZ.{]} This occurs with
    Norris et al. (2006) cross-identifications, as these are associated with
    the first data release of ATLAS. The first data release went to a depth
    of {[}TODO: depth of DR1{]}, compared to the depth of the third data
    release {[}TODO: depth of DR3{]} (Franzen et al. 2015) used by Radio
    Galaxy Zoo. Labels from Norris may therefore disagree with labels from
    Radio Galaxy Zoo even if they are both correct.

    There are many potential host galaxies {[}TODO: how many galaxies in
    SWIRE?{]}, so instead of using all galaxies in the CDFS field we only
    train and test our classifiers on infrared objects within a fixed radius
    \(R\) of an ATLAS radio object. For this radius we choose \(1'\), the
    same radius as the images shown to volunteers in RGZ. In general this
    will result in cases where the host galaxy is outside the radius (such
    as radio objects with wide-angled tails, e.g.~Banfield et al. (2016)),
    but this is unavoidable. We may also choose a radius which is too
    \emph{large}, worsening our assumption that there is only one host
    galaxy in this radius, but again, this is unavoidable.

    {[}How badly does this assumption hurt us? How does a perfect binary
    classifier behave under these assumptions?{]}

    (TODO: Describe how we assigned labels given that RGZ only labels the
    first component.)

  \subsection{Experimental Setup}\label{experimental-setup}

    \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{images/quadrants.pdf}
    \caption{CDFS field training and testing quadrants. The central dot is
    located at 52h48m00s -28Â°06m00s. There are similar numbers of radio
    sources in each quadrant.\label{fig:quadrants}}
    \end{figure}

    We trained cross-identifiers on radio objects from the ATLAS
    observations of the Chandra Deep Field - South (CDFS) using Radio Galaxy
    Zoo cross-identifications, and compared the trained cross-identifiers to
    those trained on a set of expert cross-identifications of the same
    field. We then applied the cross-identifiers trained on CDFS to the ESO
    Large Area ISO Survey - South 1 (ELAIS-S1) field {[}TODO{]}.

    We divided the CDFS field into four quadrants for training and testing.
    The quadrants were centred on 52h48m00s -28Â°06m00s
    ({Figure}\ref{fig:quadrants}). For each trial, one quadrant
    was used to draw test examples, and the other three quadrants were used
    for training examples.

    We further divided the radio components into compact and resolved.
    Compact components are trivially cross-identified by fitting a Gaussian
    (as in Norris et al. 2006) and we would expect any machine learning
    approach for host cross-identification to attain high accuracy on this
    set. Whether a component was resolved was decided based on its flux; a
    radio component was considered resolved if \[
        \ln \left(\frac{S_{\text{int}}}{S_{\text{peak}}}\right) > 2\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_{S_{\text{int}}}}{S_{\text{int}}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_{S_{\text{peak}}}}{S_{\text{peak}}}\right)^2}
    \] and compact otherwise, where \(S_{\text{int}}\) is the integrated
    flux and \(S_{\text{peak}}\) is the peak flux.

    We considered only radio objects with a cross-identification in both the
    Norris et al. (2006) catalogue and the RGZ catalogue. Candidate hosts
    were then selected from the SWIRE catalogue. For a given subset of radio
    objects, all SWIRE objects within \(R\) of all radio objects in the
    subset were added to the associated SWIRE subset.

    Each classifier was trained on the training examples and used to predict
    labels for the test examples. The predicted labels were compared to the
    labels derived from the Norris et al. (2006) cross-identifications and
    the balanced accuracy was computed. We used balanced accuracy as our
    accuracy measure due to the highly imbalanced classes --- in our total
    set of SWIRE objects within \(R\) of an ATLAS object, only 4\% have
    positive labels. The accuracies were then averaged across all four
    quadrants. Classification outputs are reported for the testing quadrant.
    We report the balanced accuracy on the classification task for logistic
    regression, convolutional neural networks, and random forests.

    We then used the outputs of our classifiers to predict the host galaxy
    for each radio component cross-identified by both Norris et al. (2006)
    and Radio Galaxy Zoo. For each SWIRE object within \(R\) of the radio
    component, the probability of the object having a positive label was
    estimated using the trained binary classifiers. The SWIRE object with
    the highest probability was chosen as the host galaxy. The accuracy was
    then estimated by counting how many predicted host galaxies matched the
    Norris et al. (2006) cross-identifications.

    The balanced accuracy provides a good proxy to the accuracy of the host
    cross-identification task. To check this, we selected random, small
    subsets of the SWIRE training objects, and for each random subset
    trained a logistic regression classifier. The balanced accuracy of this
    classifier was computed and compared with the accuracy of this
    classifier on the host cross-identification task. These accuracies are
    plotted against each other in {Figure}\ref{fig:gct-to-xid}. We
    found a positive correlation. Additionally, we compared the balanced
    accuracy of the classifier to the mean distance of the predicted host
    galaxy from the true host galaxy, also finding a positive correlation.
    {[}this is kind of a result, but it's used to describe why we chose the
    method we did to report --- should it go in the results and then
    discussion section, or here?{]}
